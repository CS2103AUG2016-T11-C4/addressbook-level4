    # Product survey on Wunderlist.exe
    
    ## Introduction
    
    Written in Javascript and PHP, Wunderlist is a task manager application with a
    simple, intuitive,and beautiful User Interface that is installed locally on the
    hard disk. It has server functions to share todo lists and is able to sync
    information using a Wunderlist account. Thus CRUD of local tasks work offline,
    but with online, additional syncing, sharing and collaborating features are
    accessible.
    
    Throughout this survey, task and to-do mean the same thing.
    
    ## CRUD for Tasks
    
    Wunderlist supports the full functionality of Create Read Update Delete of
    tasks.
    
    **Creating Tasks**
    
    With the cursor at the To-Do bar, a task can be added by simply typing in the
    name and hitting enter. Multiple task can be created with ease with only the
    keyboard by repeating the above step. A new task can be created with the
    default short-cut keys: Ctrl+N. This brings the cursor to the to do bar without
    having to use the mouse.
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/create_task.PNG)
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/create_task2.PNG)
    
    Setting a due date and starring (highlighting) the task can be done during the
    creation of a task. This requires point and click to click on the Set Due Date
    and Star task icons.
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/set_dd_star.png)
    
    **Reading Task**
    
    A list view of task is always shown in the main window of Wunderlist. It is
    automatically updated to reflect any changes made to tasks.
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/read_task.png)
    
    Different lists can be created to group task. To create a list, click on +
    Create list at the bottom left of the window, or use the default shortcut keys:
    Ctrl+Shift+L. The column on the left houses the different lists. User can use
    point and click or arrow keys to toggle between the different list. Inbox is
    the name of the default list.
    
    **Updating Task**
    
    Wunderlist allows user to add/change the following details of a task after its
    creation:
    
    * Task name
    
    * Due date
    
    * Reminder date
    
    * Subtask
    
    * Task notes
    
    * File attachments
    
    To do so, user must select the task, and the editable Task details column will
    appear. This can be done by point and click. Task selection can also be done
    with the arrow keys, but first the user have to toggle the cursor to a Task.
    (For example if the cursor is at the To-do bar, pressing the arrow keys will
    not work. User will first have to click on a task). The selected Task is
    highlighted Cyan, while the rest will appear white.
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/edit_task.png)
    
    **Deleting Task**
    
    For deleting a task, i.e removing a task from the list view, there are two ways
    it can be done.
    
    1. 1)Mark as completed, task will then be transferred to completed task list
    2. 2)Permanently delete from memory
    
    1) To mark a task as complete, click on the small square box on the task, or
    use short cut keys: Ctrl+D (Task must be highlighted cyan first). A
    &quot;Ding&quot; will sound  on successful mark completion of a task.
    
    2) To permanently delete from memory, right click on task, and click on Delete
    To-Do. Or, when the task is selected, use short-cut keys: Ctrl+Backspace
    
    ## Features:
    
    ## CRUD of tasks works offline
    
    **Positive:**  Performs the basic functions of task management without
    dependency on a constant  internet connection.
    
    ## Sync from account
    
    Automatic syncing when there is internet connection. Option to manually sync by
    clicking &lt;My profile name&gt; ? Sync Now or by pressing R.
    
    Positive: a user&#39;s wunderlist data can be used across machines. For
    example, user bought a new laptop. After downloading Wunderlist on new machine,
    user can import his/her data from previous wunderlist into new wunderlist,
    since data is saved to an account stored on the server.
    
    ## Sharing Lists
    
    All list except the default inbox list can be shared. Add list collaborators by
    typing their wunderlist account name/registered email. Works only with internet
    connection.
    
    Positive: A team&#39;s todo list, viewed and updated in real time. Allows team
    members to know what has been done, left to do, details of the task.
    
    Assign to whom option in shared list. Option to view tasks &quot;Assigned to
    me&quot;
    
    Positive: easy assignment of roles and tasks in a team. Clear view of
    user&#39;s responsibilities.
    
    ## Short cut keys
    
    Table of functions assigned with shortcut keys
    
    | Add new to do | CTRL+N |
    | --- | --- |
    | Add new List | CTRL+SHIFT+L |
    | Mark selected todos as completed | CTRL+D |
    | Star selected todos | CTRL+S |
    | Select all to-dos | CTRL+A |
    | Delete selected list or to-do | CTRL+BACKSPACE |
    | Copy selected todo | CTRL+C |
    | Paste todo | CTRL+V |
    | search | CTRL+F |
    | sync | R |
    
    Shortcut keys are fully customisable.
    
    Positive: Increases user flexibility. Suitable for users who prefer to use the
    keyboard.
    
    Negative: It is still not completely functional via keyboard only. Eg. point
    and click must be used to switch out of create task mode to carry out other
    functionalities.
    
    ## Today&#39;s list and This Week&#39;s list
    
    Task with due dates are automatically sorted into Todays list and This
    week&#39;s list.
    
    Positive: useful for keeping track of deadlines due today and due in a week.
    
    ## Arrange tasks in list
    
    Drag and drop task in a list to arrange them.
    
    Positive: A way of prioritising task
    
    Negative: Only achievable via point and click.
    
    ## Summon Wunderlist via point and click on app icon
    
    Negative: Slow
    
    ## View completed task
    
    Positive: keep track of what has been done, especially useful in a shared list
    where the marking a task as complete may be done by others
    
    Negative: have to do a constant cleanup of todos in the completed todos list.
    There is the option of selecting all using
    
    ## Undo an action
    
    No command or key to do that, but there is a function to unmark a completed
    todo. This restores the task from the completed task list back to the list it
    was from.
    
    ## Simple search
    
    Ctrl+F to search

###### docs\UserGuide.md

    ## Quick Start
    
    1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
    
        > Note: Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
        > This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
    2. Download the latest `TaskTracker.jar` from the 'releases' tab.
    
    3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your task database.
    
    4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
    
    5. Set up: enter your name and verify the current date and time.
    
    6. You're good to go! Try adding your first Task. Press Enter to enter a
       command. For adding a floating task, try:
    
    	* `add "Learn Task Tracker"`.
    
        ![alt text](./images/userguide/1.png "command bar")
    
        Let's do another one:
    
    	* `add "bake potatoes" p-2`
    
        ![alt text](./images/userguide/2.png "")
    
        Notice how `bake potatoes` is below `Learn Task Tracker`. That's because
        `bake potatoes` is of number 2 priority, while `Learn Task Tracker` with an
        undefined priority takes the default highest priority number of 0.
    
    7. Let's add deadline tasks with due date and time.
    
    	* `add "bake cookies" 31/12 3pm`
    
            `bake cookies` by 31 December of this year, 3pm. Undeclared year in date
            field will be taken as the current year.
    
    	* `add "bake cookies" tdy 3pm`
    
            `bake cookies` by today, 3pm.
    
        ![alt text](./images/userguide/3.png "")
    
    8. Next up, events. An event is a task with a start date, start time, end date
       and end time. Example commands are:
    
    	* `add "CS2103t programming camp" 30/8 1pm to 3/1/2017 6pm`
    
            Event `CS2103t programming camp` starts from 1pm of the 30th August 2016, and ends at 6pm of the 3rd January 2017.
    
    	* `add "potato peeling" tdy 3pm to 7pm`
    
            Event `potato peeling` starts from today's 3pm and ends at today's 7pm.
    
    	* `add "cupcake festival" tdy 8pm tmr 12pm`
    
            Event `cupcake festival` starts from today's 8pm and ends at tomorrow's 12 pm.
    
    	* `add "Trick or treat" 31/10 8pm to 9pm`
    
            Event `Trick or treat` starts from 8pm of 31st October this year and ends on the same day's 9pm.
    
        ![alttext](./images/userguide/4.png "")
    
    9. To delete a task, try:
    
        ```
        del-float 2
        ```
    
        Delete floating task `bake potatoes`.
    
        ```
        del-deadline 1
        ```
    
        Delete deadline task `bake cookies`.
    
        ```
        del-event 4
        ```
    
        Delete Event `Trick or treat`.
    
        ![alttext](./images/userguide/5.png "")
    
    10. To edit a deadline, try:
    
    	* `edit-deadline 1 dd-29/12 dt-2pm`
    
            The following properties of task are modified: 'due date' and 'due time'. (`dd` refers to due date, `dt` refers to due time)
    
    	* `edit-deadline 1 dt-3pm`
    
            Only the due time of `bake cookies` is modified.
    
        ![alttext](./images/userguide/6.png "")
    
    11. To edit an event, try:
    
    	* `edit-event 2 loc-NUS`
    
            Location of `potato peeling` set to NUS.
    
    	* `edit-event 3 st-3pm sd-12oct et-5pm ed-13oct loc-Yishun`
    
            All fields modified. (`st` : `starting time`, `sd` : `starting date`,
            `et` : `ending time`, `ed` : `ending date`)
    
            ![alttext](./images/userguide/7.png "")
    
        * `edit-event 2 st-3pm`
    
            Start time of `potato peeling` modified.
    
            ![alttext](./images/userguide/8.png "")
    
    12. To edit a floating task, try:
    
    	* `edit-float 1 p-1`
    
            Floating Task `Learn Task Tracker` is given a priority of `1`.
    
            ![alttext](./images/userguide/9.png "")
    
    13. If you've finished a task. Congrations! Let's mark that task as finshed.
    
         * `fin-float 1`
    
            Floating task `Learn Task Tracker` will be marked as finished.
    
         * `fin-deadline 1`
    
            Deadline task `bake cookies` will be marked as finished.
    
    14. To exit the program, please enter:
    
    	 * `exit`
    
            Close the Task-tracker.
