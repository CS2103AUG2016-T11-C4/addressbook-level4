    # Product survey on Wunderlist.exe
    
    ## Introduction
    
    Written in Javascript and PHP, Wunderlist is a task manager application with a
    simple, intuitive,and beautiful User Interface that is installed locally on the
    hard disk. It has server functions to share todo lists and is able to sync
    information using a Wunderlist account. Thus CRUD of local tasks work offline,
    but with online, additional syncing, sharing and collaborating features are
    accessible.
    
    Throughout this survey, task and to-do mean the same thing.
    
    ## CRUD for Tasks
    
    Wunderlist supports the full functionality of Create Read Update Delete of
    tasks.
    
    **Creating Tasks**
    
    With the cursor at the To-Do bar, a task can be added by simply typing in the
    name and hitting enter. Multiple task can be created with ease with only the
    keyboard by repeating the above step. A new task can be created with the
    default short-cut keys: Ctrl+N. This brings the cursor to the to do bar without
    having to use the mouse.
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/create_task.PNG)
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/create_task2.PNG)
    
    Setting a due date and starring (highlighting) the task can be done during the
    creation of a task. This requires point and click to click on the Set Due Date
    and Star task icons.
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/set_dd_star.png)
    
    **Reading Task**
    
    A list view of task is always shown in the main window of Wunderlist. It is
    automatically updated to reflect any changes made to tasks.
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/read_task.png)
    
    Different lists can be created to group task. To create a list, click on +
    Create list at the bottom left of the window, or use the default shortcut keys:
    Ctrl+Shift+L. The column on the left houses the different lists. User can use
    point and click or arrow keys to toggle between the different list. Inbox is
    the name of the default list.
    
    **Updating Task**
    
    Wunderlist allows user to add/change the following details of a task after its
    creation:
    
    * Task name
    
    * Due date
    
    * Reminder date
    
    * Subtask
    
    * Task notes
    
    * File attachments
    
    To do so, user must select the task, and the editable Task details column will
    appear. This can be done by point and click. Task selection can also be done
    with the arrow keys, but first the user have to toggle the cursor to a Task.
    (For example if the cursor is at the To-do bar, pressing the arrow keys will
    not work. User will first have to click on a task). The selected Task is
    highlighted Cyan, while the rest will appear white.
    
    ![](../images/wunderlist/edit_task.png)
    
    **Deleting Task**
    
    For deleting a task, i.e removing a task from the list view, there are two ways
    it can be done.
    
    1. 1)Mark as completed, task will then be transferred to completed task list
    2. 2)Permanently delete from memory
    
    1) To mark a task as complete, click on the small square box on the task, or
    use short cut keys: Ctrl+D (Task must be highlighted cyan first). A
    &quot;Ding&quot; will sound  on successful mark completion of a task.
    
    2) To permanently delete from memory, right click on task, and click on Delete
    To-Do. Or, when the task is selected, use short-cut keys: Ctrl+Backspace

    ## Basic Features
###### docs/UserGuide.md

    ### Add a Deadline Task
    You receive an email from your boss, requesting for the project proposal to be in by 31 dec of this year, 3pm. Let's add a deadline tasks with due date and time.
      	
        add "submit project proposal" 31/12 3pm
    
    * Undeclared year in date field will be taken as the current year.
             
    You decide to set a deadline for the first milestone of your project to be completed by today, 5pm.
    
     	add "finish project milestone 1" 5pm
        
     While working so hard and staring at the computer screen continuously, your eyes start to feel tried. The eyebreak you took just now was really good. You should take an eye break tommorrow too.
    
    ```
    add "take eye break" tmr
    ```
    
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/3.png "")
    
    * Keywords like `tdy`, `tmr`, `yst`, can be used in the `DATE` field.
    
    * Formats of `DATE` and `TIME` should follow those stated above in this user guide. See [Date Format](#date-format) and [Time Format](#time-format)
    
    * Task Tracker understands the importance of tackling the tasks which are due soon, first. Therefore, deadline task are automatically arranged according to their due dates and times. Those with encroaching deadlines are placed at the top of the list. 
     
    * Typing additional words when you don't actually need to can be a chore. Task Tracker cuts your fingers some slack by taking an undeclared date as today, and an undeclared time as the end of the date specified. However, at least either one date or time has to be specified for deadline task, or task tracker will mistake it for a floating task!
    
    * Overdue deadline tasks are highlighted in red.
     
    ### Add an Event Task
    
    Your phone bleeps. Wow, an invitation to attend the Avengers meetup organised by Dr Strange! It happens tommorow, 10pm to 11 pm.
       
        add "avangers meetup" tmr 10pm to 11pm
      
    * Next up, events. An event is a task with a start date, start time, end date
    and end time. The word `to` is used to seperate the start date and time from the end date and time. It is also how you tell Task Tracker that the task is an event. When you don't inform Task Tracker of the end date, Task Tracker will assume that the event ends on the same day which it starts.
    
    You recieved an urgent call from boss! There is a VIP meeting today, 4pm to 6pm.
       
        add "VIP meeting" 4pm to 6pm
    
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/4.png "")
    
    * As with deadlines, Task tracker will take an unspecified start date to be today.
    
    * Task Tracker will keep track of Events that has already passed, strike them out for you, and highlight ongoing events green. 
    
    * Events are automatically arranged in order of start date and time, so that you know which event to zipp to next with a quick glance at the top of the events pane.  
    
    ### Delete a Task
    
    Given the amount of work you have to do, you decide not to go to the Avengers meetup. Let's delete that from Task Tracker.
        
        del e1
        
    ![alttext](./images/userguide/5.png "")
    
    * Can you guess the pattern? The same thing applies for deleting deadline tasks and floating Tasks! It is always `del` followed by the index of the Task, which can be seen situated to the left of the Task. Indexes for floating, deadline and event tasks have the prefix `e`, `f` and `d` respectively.
    
    	* `del INDEX`
    
    * You can delete finished Tasks too.
    
    ### Edit a Floating Task
    Since you're almost done learning Task Tracker, why not aim to finish it soon. Let's increase it's priority to 5.  
    
    	edit f1 p-5
    
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/6.png "")
    
    * The format is Field_reference-New_Field. In this example p- is the flag and 5 is the new field value.
    
    |Flag | Definition                    |
    |:----------------|:-----------------------------|
    | n- | name |
    | p- | priority |
    
    As with editing any type of Task, you may add on, in any order after `edit INDEX`, multiple fields which you want to edit. Seperate the fields with a SPACE. Prefix your changes with the flags provided in the table above for the respective fields you want to edit.
    
    * `edit INDEX n-NEW_NAME p-NEW_PRIORITY` 
    
    * Quotation marks are not required for `NEW_NAME`.
    
    * `PRIORITY` is an integer that ranges that from `0` to `5`, where `0` is the lowest priority and `5` is the highest priority.
    
    ### Edit a Deadline Task
    
    You decide to give your project milestone a specific name. You also estimate that you can finish your first milestone quickly and thus you decide to shift forward your deadline.
    
    	edit d1 n-source for supliers dt-2pm
    
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/7.png "")
    
    * The following properties of Deadline Task are modified: name and due time. 
    
    |Flag | Definition                        |
    |:----------------|:---------------------------------|
    | n- | name |
    | dd- | due date |
    | dt- | due time |
    
    As with editing any type of task, you can specify the fields you want to edit in any order after `edit INDEX`. Separate the fields with a SPACE. Prefix your changes with the flags provided in the table above for the respective fields you want to edit.
    
    * `edit INDEX n-NEW_NAME dd-NEW_DUE_DATE dt-NEW_DUE_TIME` 
    
    * Quotation marks are not required for `NEW_NAME`.
    
    ### Edit an Event Task
    You recieve an email saying that the VIP meeting's start time has been brought forward to 10am. You take note of that by editing the start time of VIP meeting in Task Tracker:
    
    	edit e2 st-10am
    
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/8.png "")
    
    |Flag | Definition                  |
    |----------------|:--------------------------- |
    | n- | name |
    | sd- | start date |
    | st- | start time |
    | ed- | end date |
    | et- | end time |
    
    As with editing any type of task, you can specify the fields you want to edit in any order after `edit INDEX`. Separate the fields with a SPACE. Prefix your changes with the flags provided in the table above for the respective fields you want to edit.
    
    * `edit INDEX n-NEW_NAME sd-NEW_START_DATE st-NEW_START_TIME ed-NEW_END_DATE et-NEW_END_TIME` 
    
    * Quotation marks are not required for `NEW_NAME`.
    
    ### List all Tasks
    After all the adding, editing and deleting, you may notice that the indexes are out of order. If that irks you, simply enter `list` into the command bar. Your indexes should be reordered.
    
    	list
        
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/9.png "")
    
    ### Mark a Task as Finished
    You've finished learning Task Tracker. Let's mark it as finished.
    
         fin f1
    
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/10.png "")
    
    * Mark task as finished with this format: `fin INDEX`
###### docs/UserGuide.md

    ### Clear all tasks
    
    Sometimes Task Tracker gets cluttered with finished tasks and tasks you no longer need. Use `clear` to wipe all tasks from Task Tracker.
    
    	clear
        
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/13.png "")
###### docs/UserGuide.md

    ### Find by keywords
    
    Task Tracker getting too cluttered? Need to find Task containing a specific keyword? Use the find command!
    
    	find KEYWORD
    
    ![alt text](./images/userguide/14.png "")
    
    To show all tasks again, use the `list` command.
###### docs/UserGuide.md

    ### Set data storage directory
    To change the file path which holds Task Tracker's storage data, type
    
    	setdatadir FILE_PATH
    	
    Where `FILE_PATH` is the file path to the directory, eg. `C:\Users\Potato\Desktop`
    
    Congratulations! You have officially finished learning task tracker. Take on this challenge: Mark learn task tracker as finished.
    
    	fin learn task tracker

    #### Undo/Redo implementation
The `Commit` class nested in `ModelManager` holds the name (a String) of a `Command` and also a copy of a `WorkingTaskBook`. `ModelManager` has a list of commits. There is a head label which always point to the `Commit` containing the curent `WorkingTaskBook`. Right after `LogicManager` executes a `Command` and updates the `TaskBook` with the relevant changes, model.hasUncommittedChanges() is called to check if the `Command` recently called caused a change in `TaskBook`. If yes, a new `Commit` is created to store the current state of the `WorkingTaskBook` and the name of the recently executed `Command`. This `Commit` is then added to the list of commits. Head label is updated accordingly. When undo is executed, the head label shifts down the list to point to the previous `Commit`. The `WorkingTaskBook` of that `Commit` is then loaded as the current `WorkingTaskbook`. For redo, the head label shifts up the list to point to the forerunner `Commit`, after which the `WorkingTaskBook` in that `Commit` is loaded and set as the current `WorkingTaskBook`. Current `WorkingTaskBook` replacement caused by undo and redo will not be saved as `Commits`, since the check for uncommited changes is done by comparing the current `WorkingTaskBook` with the one at which head points to for changes. When a new `Commit` is about to be added to the list of commits and head is not at the top of the list, all the commits after head is removed and then the new `Commit` enters the list. Head is shifted to the top of the list. This is to delete all redoable actions after an action other than undo/redo which causes data changes is executed. `HeadAtBoundaryException` is thrown when there are no commits available for undoing/redoing.
