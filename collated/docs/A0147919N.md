    ## Use case: Add priority tags
    
    **MSS**
    
    1. The user requests to add a priority tag for a specified event.
    
    2. TaskTracker prompts the user to select the priority level of the event -
       "Very Important"/ "Important"/ "Not important".
    
    3. The user selects the appropriate priority level for the event from these
       options.
    
    4. TaskManager updates the priority of the event with the specified priority, and it is displayed on the user's schedule.
    
    5. The user is notified that the update was successful.
    
       Use case ends.
    
    **Extensions**
    
    1a. The user places a request to add a priority tag, but does not add it.
    
    > 1a1. User presses "Esc". TaskTracker goes back to the normal view of the
    > schedule. Now even if the user clicks on any event, priority tag options will
    > not be displayed as the TaskTracker switched from Priority Tag view to Normal
    > view.
    
    > Use case ends.
    
    ## Use case: Add new event under a specific "group activity"
    
    **MSS**
    
    1. User requests to add a new event to a group activity.
    
    2. If the user wants to create a new group activity, he places a request to add new group activity. 
    
    3. The user then enters the details of the group activity (such as name of the
       group activity and email addresses of the people in the group).
    
    4. TaskTracker automatically adds the event to this new activity.
    
    5. TaskTracker notifies the user that the event has been added to the schedule.
    
       User case ends.
    
    **Extensions**
    
    1a. The user enters an invalid email address of a group member, while creating
    a new group activity.
    
    > 1a1. TaskTracker displays the error message - "Invalid email".
    
    > Use case ends.
    
    1b. The user enters a group activity name that already exists, while adding a
        new group activity.
    
    > 1b1. TaskTracker displays an error message "Name already exists".
    
    > Use case ends.
    
    ## Use case: Add event description
    
    **MSS**
    
    1. The user requests to add a new event.
    
    2. The user writes a small description about the event in the "Description"
       field, present in the "Add new event" window.
    
    3. The event is added and the user is notified about the new event added.
    
       User case ends.
    
    ## Use case: Set reminders
    
    **MSS**
    
    1. When adding a new event, the user adds the time at which he wants to set a
       reminder, before the event occurs. The time is entered in day/hours/minutes
       format.
    
    2. The new event is added to the schedule and the user is notified about the
       addition of the new event.
    
       User case ends.
    
    **Extensions**
    
    1a. The user enters the time in a wrong format.
    
    > 1a1. TaskTracker shows an error message "Invalid time format"
    
    > User case ends.

    Google Calendar is essentially a time-management mobile and web application
    developed by Google. It is a good platform for office workers, such as Jimmy to
    organize their schedule. It has most of the features that an office worker like
    Jim would require; for example, Add/Edit/Delete tasks, automatically find free
    slots in the schedule to add new tasks, “quick add”, ability to block multiple
    tasks, etc. It can also support features such as import, export and sync with
    desktop programs such as Outlook  and also, with mobile devices. However, it
    also has a few drawbacks for workers like Jim - New tasks or modification of
    existing tasks cannot be performed when the user is offline, it does not
    display floating tasks, and also does not display the status of a task as
    "done" or "not done".
    
    We have taken some reference features from Google Calendar to implement in our
    own time management software. Some of these include having an feature to find
    empty time slots in the user’s schedule. While adding an event in Google
    Calendar, the users have an option called "Find Time" in which all the free
    slots in their schedule are displayed and they can choose any one for adding
    their task.
