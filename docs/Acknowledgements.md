# Acknowledgments

We would like to thank our project supervisor, Chua Ka Yi Ong, as well as Prof Damith C. Rajapakse and his
teaching team for mentoring us throughout this project.

Our code is based on the [Addressbook-Level4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4) code which was developed by the [SE-EDU](https://github.com/se-edu) initiative.

Our code also depends on several third-party libraries:

* [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for our data storage logic
* [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) for its various utilities
* [FontawesomeFX](https://bitbucket.org/Jerady/fontawesomefx) for our user interface icons
* [RichtextFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/RichTextFX) for our command box and tab-completion popup
* [JUnit4](http://junit.org/junit4/) for testing
* [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/) for mocks and stubs
* [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) for GUI testing
