## Setting up

### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
      This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE

3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in [this
   page][efxclipse-install])

4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace

[efxclipse-install]: http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious

### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer

2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and
   **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)

3. Click `File` > `Import`

4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`

5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory

6. Click `Finish`

* If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to
  'keep'.

* Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30
  minutes for the set up to finish (This is because Gradle downloads library
  files from servers during the project set up process)

* If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can
  discard those changes.

### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**

* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognise new files that appeared due to the Git
  pull.

* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:

  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` ->
  `Refresh Gradle Project`.

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**

* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project
  import.

* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](#testing-with-gradle) once to download all
  required libraries.

## Design

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/devguide/architecture.png)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of
the App.

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`][mainapp-src]. It is responsible
for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and
  connect them up with each other.

* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes their cleanup method
  where necessary.

[mainapp-src]: ../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java

**`Commons`** represents a collection of classes used by multiple other
components. Of these classes, two of them play important roles in the
application architecture:

* `EventsCentre`: This singleton class is used by components to communicate
  with other components using events.

* `LogsCenter`: This singleton class is used by classes to write log messages
  to the application log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the application in-memory.

* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to,
  the hard disk.

* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Parses and executes commands.

* [**`Ui`**](#ui-component): The user interface of the application.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.

* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### Model component

![Model component class diagram](images/devguide/comp-model.png)

The `Model` component:

* holds the task book data in memory. In particular, it stores the list of
  floating, deadline and event tasks.

* exposes three lists for the stored floating, deadline and event tasks
  respectively.  These lists can be "observed". For example, the Ui component
  registers event listeners on these lists so that the Ui automatically updates
  when the data in these lists change.

### Storage component

![Storage component class diagram](images/devguide/comp-storage.png)

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format to the hard disk and read it back.

* can save `TaskBook` objects in json format to the hard disk and read it back.

### Logic component

![Logic component class diagram](images/devguide/comp-logic.png)

The `Logic` component:

* parses and executes user commands.

* filters the lists of floating, deadline and event tasks in the task book.

It accomplishes its parsing and execution of user commands in a few steps:

1. `Logic` uses its own internal `Parser` to parse the user command.

2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.

4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult`
   object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic`
component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Sequence diagram for event deletion](images/devguide/seq-deleteevent.png)

### Ui component

![Ui component class diagram](images/devguide/comp-ui.png)

The `Ui` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when
  data in the `Model` change.

* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI
  accordingly.

The Ui consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`,
`ResultDisplay`, `EventTaskListPane`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these,
including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `Ui` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are
defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view`
folder. For example, the layout of `MainWindow` is specified in
`src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml`.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is
used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the
  configuration file (See [Configuration](#configuration))

* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`
  which will log messages according to the specified logging level.

* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE`: Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination
  of the application

* `WARNING`: Can continue, but with caution

* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.

* `FINE`: Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in
  debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

## Configuration

By default, the application stores its configuration in the `config.json` file.
This file can be modified to change the configuration of the application.

* `appTitle`: The title of the application. This title will be displayed in the
  user interface. (Default: `Task Tracker`)

* `taskBookName`: Name of the user's task book. This name will be displayed in
  the user interface. (Default: `MyTaskBook`)

* `logLevel`: Sets the minimum required level for log messages to be
  output. See [Logging Levels](#logging-levels) for the list of available
  levels. (Default: `INFO`)

* `userPrefsFilePath`: The path to the user's preference file. (Default:
  `preferences.json`)

* `taskBookFilePath`: The path to the user's task book file. (Default:
  `data/taskbook.json`)

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by
   simulating user actions on the GUI.  These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:

   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes.

      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`

   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code
      units (those code units are assumed to be working).

      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`

   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple
      code units as well as how the are connected together.

      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

### Testing with Eclipse

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run
  as` > `JUnit Test`

* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class,
  or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

### Testing with Gradle

* To run all tests, execute the following in the project work
  directory:

      ./gradle test

* To only run non-GUI tests, execute the following in the project work
  directory:

      ./gradle -PguiTests=false test

### Troubleshooting tests

**Problem: Tests fail because a NullPointException was thrown when
AssertionError is expected**

* Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.
  This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)

* Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described
  [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).
  Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

# Appendix E: Product Survey

## Todo.txt

Full product survey [here](productsurveys/todo.txt.md)

Jim's Requirement | Todo.txt Support
:---------------- | ----------------
Summoned quickly from anywhere | No
Keyboard-oriented. Jim can type commands in "one shot" | Yes
Works offline | Yes
Simple search | Yes
CRUD support for floating tasks | Full
CRUD support for deadlines | Partial
CRUD support for events | Partial
Keep track of which items are done/not done | Yes
Look for a suitable slot to schedule an item | No
Ability to "block" multiple slots | No
Flexibility in command line format | Tiny
Undo operations | No

Todo.sh, as a command-line application, is fully keyboard oriented and thus
suitable for power users who prefer entering commands in one shot. As it only
operates on local text files, it works fully offline.

Furthermore, its data model and user interface is specially geared towards the
creation, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) of floating tasks, which it
does quite well. One exception is the interface to edit the name of a task,
which is very clunky as it requires the user to repeat existing
information.

While the simplicity and flexibility of its data model means that CRUD
operations on deadlines and events are technically feasible, the lack of
explicit support from the application and data model means that the user
interface is poor and error checking is lacking. Users who store their
deadlines and events in todo.txt, without understanding how it works under the
hood, would thus be in for some nasty surprises.

Furthermore, the lack of explicit support for deadlines and events means that
the application has no support at all for looking for a slot to schedule an
item and the ability to “block” multiple time slots, as it has no concept of
time at all.

Finally, it has no support for undoing operations. While this is alleviated
somewhat as it asks for confirmation before deleting tasks, all other
operations are done without user confirmation.

## Todoist

Jim’s Requirement | Todoist support
:---------------- | ------------------
Summoned quickly from anywhere | No
Keyboard-oriented. Jim can type commands in “one shot”. | No
Keyboard-oriented. Jim can use keyboard shortcut to increase efficiency. | Yes
Works offline | Yes
Simple Search | Yes
CRUD support for floating tasks | Full

CRUD support for events | None
Keep track of which items are done/not done | Yes

Ability to “block” multiple slots. | No
Flexibility in command line format. | No
Undo operations | Partial

Todoist is a half keyboard oriented cross-platform applications, with plenty of
useful keyboard short-cut on both PC and Web clients. It can work both online
or offline on mobile phone or personal computer.

It fully supports creation, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) function of
floating tasks and deadline-like task. The user interface is well designed and
user can perform their actions quite easily through it. Besides, user can also
conduct simple searching action among all task he or she has created. However,
Todoist also does not support the functionality to add event-like task at all.

Also for premium account, Todoist also gives the support of tracking the task
that has already been done or finished, which gives convenience for user to
record their working history.

Besides, Todoist can automatically suggest how many tasks have already existed
on a certain day when creating the tasks. But since Todoist does not support
event-like task, it also has no support at all for generating suggestion of
suitable time-slots or placing multiple time slots/blocks when creating the
tasks.

Moreover, Todoist does support undo-actions, but only for the last one actions
the user performs.

Furthermore, there are several features that we could learn from Todoist. The
first one is the "Quick-Add" function which enables the user to add either
floating task or deadline task in a single window. The second one is the "Undo"
command, which enables the user to undo the last command immediately when them
perform wrongly.

## Wunderlist

Full product survey [here](productsurveys/Wunderlist.md)

Wunderlist in brief: Written in Javascript and PHP, Wunderlist is a task
manager application with a simple, intuitive,and beautiful User Interface that
is installed locally on the hard disk. It has server functions to share todo
lists and is able to sync information using a Wunderlist account. Thus CRUD of
local tasks work offline, but with online, additional syncing, sharing and
collaborating features are accessible.

So, how well does Wunderlist satisfy Jim's requirements?

Google Calendar is essentially a time-management mobile and web application
developed by Google. It is a good platform for office workers, such as Jimmy to
organize their schedule. It has most of the features that an office worker like
Jim would require; for example, Add/Edit/Delete tasks, automatically find free
slots in the schedule to add new tasks, “quick add”, ability to block multiple
tasks, etc. It can also support features such as import, export and sync with
desktop programs such as Outlook  and also, with mobile devices. However, it
also has a few drawbacks for workers like Jim - New tasks or modification of
existing tasks cannot be performed when the user is offline, it does not
display floating tasks, and also does not display the status of a task as
"done" or "not done".

We have taken some reference features from Google Calendar to implement in our
own time management software. Some of these include having an feature to find
empty time slots in the user’s schedule. While adding an event in Google
Calendar, the users have an option called "Find Time" in which all the free
slots in their schedule are displayed and they can choose any one for adding
their task.
