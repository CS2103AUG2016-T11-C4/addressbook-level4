## About

Unable to keep track of all your deadlines and other commitments?  Finding it
difficult to remember tasks which do not have a specific date and time, but
nevertheless needs to be done?

Fret not, TaskTracker is here to your rescue!

To be simply defined, TaskTracker is a digital assistant that keeps your
schedule neat and organized. It displays all your events lined up for the day,
upcoming deadlines and also tasks that do not have a specific time/ date, on
the same window.

You can perform various operations such as add/ delete/ edit/ prioritize, on
your events by simply typing a one-line command,
as TaskTracker has a flexible command line interface suited to your needs and comfort.
You don’t need to waste any
more time navigating through multiple options or filling multiple fields every
time you want to modify your schedule.

TaskTracker makes time-management smart and simple for you!

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.

    > Note: Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
    > This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. Download the latest `TaskTracker.jar` from the 'releases' tab.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your task database.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

5. Set up: enter your name and verify the current date and time.

6. You're good to go! Try adding your first Task. Press Enter to enter a
   command. For adding a floating task, try:

	* `add "Learn Task Tracker" p-5`.

    ![alt text](./images/userguide/1.png "command bar")

    Let's do another one:

	* `add "bake potatoes"`

    ![alt text](./images/userguide/2.png "")

    Notice how `bake potatoes` is below `Learn Task Tracker`. That's because
    `bake potatoes` is of default priority 0, lower than `Learn Task Tracker` priority of 5.

7. Let's add deadline tasks with due date and time.

	* `add "bake cookies" 31/12 3pm`

        `bake cookies` by 31 December of this year, 3pm. Undeclared year in date
        field will be taken as the current year.

	* `add "bake cookies" tdy 3pm`

        `bake cookies` by today, 3pm.

    ![alt text](./images/userguide/3.png "")

8. Next up, events. An event is a task with a start date and time, end date and time. These are seperated by the essential keyword `to`. Example commands are:

	* `add "CS2103t programming camp" 30/8 1pm to 3/1/2017 6pm`

	* `add "potato peeling" tdy 3pm to 7pm`

	* `add "cupcake festival"  8pm to tmr 12pm`

	* `add "Trick or treat" 8pm to 9pm`
Play around with event parameter's arrangement to discover other formats valid for Task Tracker, or see Features for the answer. As you've noticed, the important keyword unique for event is 
	
   ```
   to
   ```

    ![alttext](./images/userguide/4.png "")

9. To delete a task, try:

    ```
    del-float 2
    ```

    Delete floating task `bake potatoes`.

    ```
    del-deadline 1
    ```

    Delete deadline task `bake cookies`.

    ```
    del-event 4
    ```

    Delete Event `Trick or treat`.

    ![alttext](./images/userguide/5.png "")

10. To edit a deadline, try:

	* `edit-deadline 1 dd-29/12 dt-2pm`

        The following properties of task are modified: 'due date' and 'due time'. (`dd` refers to due date, `dt` refers to due time)

	* `edit-deadline 1 dt-3pm`

        Only the due time of `bake cookies` is modified.

    ![alttext](./images/userguide/6.png "")

11. To edit an event, try:

	* `edit-event 2 loc-NUS`

        Location of `potato peeling` set to NUS.

	* `edit-event 3 st-3pm sd-12oct et-5pm ed-13oct loc-Yishun`

        All fields modified. (`st` : `starting time`, `sd` : `starting date`,
        `et` : `ending time`, `ed` : `ending date`)

        ![alttext](./images/userguide/7.png "")

    * `edit-event 2 st-3pm`

        Start time of `potato peeling` modified.

        ![alttext](./images/userguide/8.png "")

12. To edit a floating task, try:

	* `edit-float 1 p-1`

        Floating Task `Learn Task Tracker` is given a priority of `1`.

        ![alttext](./images/userguide/9.png "")

13. If you've finished a task. Congrations! Let's mark that task as finshed.

     * `fin-float 1`

        Floating task `Learn Task Tracker` will be marked as finished.

     * `fin-deadline 1`

        Deadline task `bake cookies` will be marked as finished.

14. To exit the program, please enter:

	 * `exit`

        Close the Task-tracker.

     command.
